				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The Rutherford (2016) bait and switch was example was somethign I never heard of before. I actually can't believe that Windows made the functionality of clicking X == upgrade.  I hadn't heard of friend spam before the article, and I think that's crazy that they would pretend to be the actual user and message their friends.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The misdirection one is sneaky because so often when we download any software we rarely read all the fine print. Its messed up that companies take advantage of this and change things that user likely did not realize it was changing. Many times when I download software I see that it automatically will check certain boxes, sometimes even downloading completely different software, by default.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
