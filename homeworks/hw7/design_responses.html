				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about the Gestalt principles for the first time. Emergence was interesting because
							it shows that often times a simpler image can be a better design choice then a super complex
							one, since our brains recognise the simpler images much quicker. Multi-stability was a new
							concept to me, and was interesting to find out that even when objects can be interpreted in
							various ways, our brains generally end up choosing a view to stick with.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was how the article connected the analogy of how our brain naturally
							creates familiar shapes from what may often be just pure randomness. How our brain is always
							trying to make sense of the world by using past experiences and visual patterns to
							essentially connect the dots and make sense of the world. I thought it was super cool how we
							can use this fact of how our brains work to our advantage when it comes to design.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception.
							What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to
							the message your piece is sharing?”</p>
					</li>
