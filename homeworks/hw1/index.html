	<strong><em> Computer Science, 2023 (Winter) </em></strong>
	<p>I am originally from Anaheim, California, and I transferred to UC Berkeley last year. I officially declared
		Computer Science after last Spring 2023 :)</p>
	<h4>Three favorite places to eat in Berkeley:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Imm Thai</li>
			<li>Sliver</li>
			<li>U Dessert Story</li>
		</ul>

			<li>I thought it was interesting to learn the amount of thought that goes into designing these apps in
				general. I learned that I now need to pay attention to hierarchy, content, intent, and audience when it
				comes to designing an app. I learned the importance in paying attention to who the audience is and how
				to better cater specifically to them when making design decisions.</li>
			<li>My favorite part is finding out that its not only important what content is visible, but also what
				content isn't visible. They gave a great example of this by showing that in Spotify, the New Music
				Friday has a follower count, but the playlist Release Rader did not.</li>
			<li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use
				often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on
				the screen in front of you."</li>
			<li>I would say 7, overall its a good article. I think I may have liked even more examples of good/bad
				design choices in popular apps.</li>
