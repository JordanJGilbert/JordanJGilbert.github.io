						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about how there are "optimal" speeds for interface animation. I thought it was really interesting that the optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms, and that these figures are based on qualities of the human brain. I thought it was also pretty fascinating that they found these optimal durations differ when it came to the type of device the user was using. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part or the part I thought was the most interesting was learning that its best practice to take into consideration the natural laws of physics when designing these animations. I never really thought that would be important for a virtual app, but it does now make a lot of sense to me. Its important to make sure objects in the application make movements that are possible in the real world. </p>
