						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Before reading this article, I didn't realize how important choosing type is when it comes
							to designing an application. I learned the importance of catering the typography of the
							website towards the intended audience. I also was interested to learn about the art of
							pairing fonts, with the main overarching goal of achieving maximum readability, legibility,
							and purpose.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I think my favorite part of the article is where it started dicussing the art of determing
							the best font sizes. I think it is super useful that there is a tool that exists, Modular
							Scale by Tim Brown, that can be used to create historically pleasing type sizes. The idea of
							the golden ratio and this tool, ontop of further micro adjustments in order create the most
							ascetic pleasing ratios is super interesting.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. Itâ€™s both a science and an art." </p>
					</li>
