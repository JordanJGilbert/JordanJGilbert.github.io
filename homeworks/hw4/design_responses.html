					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Before reading the article, I never really put much thought into how important it is to take
							into consideration color accessibility concerns. I see now how important it is to ensure
							people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies are able to still get the most
							out of the visual information on a website. I also learned that there were actual legal
							implications for not complying with regulatory requirements around accessibility. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was learning that there is a tool that you can use to help test the
							accessibility of color combinations like Colorable and Colorsafe. Especially as a beginner
							with basically no color theory knowledge or experience before this decal, having a tool that
							can help me out is a life saver. I also like how a lot of websites/applications have a
							colorblind-friendly mode that utilize things like texture to help assist in differentiating
							between colors.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.”</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>

							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
