                        <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> I learned that there exists a lot of very interesting transition animations that exist out
                            there. Some of these animations don't always provide crazy functionality, but a lot of them
                            definitely would improve the overally user enjoyment side of things. I also learned your can
                            add transitions to basically any part of the application, and its up to the designer to make
                            the decisions and what transitions would improve the experience of the user and the
                            functionality of the app the most.</p>

                        <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> My favorite part was honestly just looking through all these cool animations. A lot of these
                            were transitions that I have never really seen before in super popular apps. It was just
                            nice to see how talented and creative some people can really be. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how
                            the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                        <p> I liked the travel map one a lot, because I thought it was really unique the way it removed
                            possible locations dynamically as you typed in the search bar. It just does this really
                            satisfying break animation that does the job of letting the user know that a search has been
                            removed from the autocomplete engine. I also loved the create a new message animation. I
                            thought it was super cool that as you typed a message, it also simultaneously updated the
                            left message history tab.</p>
